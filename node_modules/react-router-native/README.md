A routing library for [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) that strives for sensible API parity with [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/).

```
Please note that React Router v4 was just released. Over the next few weeks,
React Router Native will be refactored to make it fully compatible with v4.

### Background

React Router community decided that a [reducer-based paradigm](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/issues/743) similar to that of **NavigationExperimental** is better suited to native navigation. Transition to a reducer-based paradigm is also being [discussed](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/issues/3190) for the web. On the other hand, NavigationExperimental [has no intention to support ](https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc/issues/64#issuecomment-209001717) a React Router-like interface and leaves the navigation state up to the developer to maintain.

A declarative API removes the need to write [boilerplate code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1dc33b5f23640a60682ac879b9a3e94a4aa519d9) and speeds up development. React Router Native follows React's __Learn Once, Write Anywhere__ principle by providing a superset of React Router's API that marries _React Router_ to _NavigationExperimental_.

#### Goals

- URL Driven Development
- Learn once, write anywhere: knowledge and proven idioms from react-router can be reused while extending them as necessary to allow navigation semantics unique to native platforms
- First class deep linking support
- [Cross-platform](#platform-support)

**Note**: This project contains components that are currently under [active](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=ericvicenti) [development](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=hedgerwang) and considered experimentalâ€”aka use in production at your own risk.

### Installation

#### Using npm:

```sh
$ npm install --save react-router-native
```

### Usage

```javascript
/**
 * index.[ios|android].js
 */

import React from 'react';
import {
  Header,
  Link,
  nativeHistory,
  Route,
  Router,
  StackRoute,
  withRouter,
} from 'react-router-native';
import {
  AppRegistry,
  ScrollView,
  StyleSheet,
  View,
} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  component: {
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    flex: 1,
  },
  home: {
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  detailCard: {
    height: 100,
    margin: 20,
    width: 100,
  },
});

const Master = (props) => (
  <View style={styles.component}>
    {props.children}
  </View>
);

const HomeHeader = withRouter((props) => {
  const handleRightButtonPress = () => {
    props.router.push('/detail/gray');
  };

  return (
    <Header
      {...props}
      style={{ backgroundColor: '#26BBE5' }}
      title="Feed"
      rightButtonText="Gray"
      onRightButtonPress={handleRightButtonPress}
    />
  );
});

const Home = () => {
  const DetailCard = ({ backgroundColor }) => (
    <Link to={`/detail/${encodeURIComponent(backgroundColor)}`} style={styles.detailCard}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor }} />
    </Link>
  );

  return (
    <ScrollView style={styles.component} contentContainerStyle={styles.home}>
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#EF4E5E" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#9498CA" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#AFCCB3" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#F0D73D" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#A176B0" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#416BB4" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#94B5DC" />
      <DetailCard backgroundColor="#D48445" />
    </ScrollView>
  );
};

const DetailHeader = withRouter((props) => {
  const { routeParams } = props;
  const title = routeParams.themeColor;
  const backgroundColor = routeParams.themeColor;
  const colors = ['#EF4E5E', '#D48445', '#AFCCB3', '#F0D73D', '#A176B0'];

  const handleRightButtonPress = () => {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length);
    const randomColor = colors[randomIndex];
    props.router.push(`/detail/${encodeURIComponent(randomColor)}`);
  };

  return (
    <Header
      {...props}
      title={title}
      style={{ backgroundColor }}
      leftButtonText="Back"
      rightButtonText="Random"
      onRightButtonPress={handleRightButtonPress}
    />
  );
});

const Detail = (props) => (
  <View style={[styles.component, { backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF' }]}>{props.children}</View>
);

const routes = (
  /* Address Bar can be toggled on or off by setting the addressBar prop */
  <Router history={nativeHistory} addressBar>
    <StackRoute path="master" component={Master}>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} overlayComponent={HomeHeader} />
      <Route path="/detail/:themeColor" component={Detail} overlayComponent={DetailHeader} />
    </StackRoute>
  </Router>
);

AppRegistry.registerComponent('YourApp', () => () => routes);
```

### Advanced Usage

You can customize behavior of the default reducers that are used to create the `navigationState` of `<Route>` or its siblings.

This allows greater customizations on how `<Link>` behaves for a particular route and is especially useful for nested `<StackRoute>`'s where default action doesn't always lead to the intended behavior, or `<TabsRoute>`'s where double-taps should reset the `navigationState` of a nested `<StackRoute>`.

```js
const reducer = (
  state: EnhancedNavigationState,
  action: NavigationAction
): EnhancedNavigationState => ({
  /* ... */
});

<TabsRoute path="/" component={Component} reducer={reducer}/>
```

### Examples
The source includes a few [examples](/examples) that should help you get started. The example app from the GIF above can be found at `examples/Aviato`. You can also [view it with Exponent](https://exp.host/@rncommunity/aviato).

Route configuration for the example apps can be found in `app/routes.js`. The __address bar__ shown in the demo is used for development only and can be disabled by removing the [`addressBar`](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native/blob/b988ea696cca272296c424e7381df00944c9d062/examples/Aviato/app/routes.js#L23-L24) prop from the ``<Router>`` component.

### Documentation
Documentation can be found [here](/docs).

### Platform Support

React Router Native is cross-platform. It supports all platforms that [NavigationExperimental](https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc) supports.
